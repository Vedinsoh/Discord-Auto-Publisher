# Auto Publisher Privacy Policy

## Overview
Auto Publisher is a collection of Discord bots designed to automatically publish messages in announcement channels. The codebase for Auto Publisher is occasionally hosted as multiple bots due to technical considerations, primarily to optimize performance in response to rate limits imposed by the Discord API.

You can access the bot's source code here: https://github.com/Vedinsoh/discord-auto-publisher

## Stored data
Auto Publisher does not store any personal data that can be used to identify users of the bot.

The bot may only store the following data related to a Discord server:
- Channel Names: The bot may store the names of channels within a Discord server. This data is only collected under the following circumstances:
   - If the bot is misused in one of the channels of your Discord server, and your server is added to a blacklist, the violating channel's name will be stored. The channel names are only used to assist server owners in identifying the specific violation within their server. This data is retained until the server ceases to use Auto Publisher bots or is explicitly deleted.

## Data access and deletion requests
To request access to personal data stored about you, or to request its deletion, to the extent permitted by GDPR, please send an email to vedinsoh@proton.me
